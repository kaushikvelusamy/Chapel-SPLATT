# SPLATT + Chapel

Port of SPLATT to Chapel

Currently how to compile:

$ make

Executable will be in bin/

Currently have mode-1 MTTKRP working. Working on the functions
after that so I can test the other MTTKRP functions.

Sorting seems to take forever for some reason. I haven't
looked into it, as its time doesn't matter to the actual
CPD. But someone worth looking into.
