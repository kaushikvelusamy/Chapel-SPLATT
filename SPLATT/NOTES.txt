Change all loops to use domains, if possible. This is supposed to speed-up the runtime bounds checking

Change memcpy calls, if possible, to use direct array assignment.

Look for places to use slicing instead of loops when doing assignment

Do entire-array operations work in parallel automatically? As in, does sqrt(A) perform the sqrt() function
on each element of A in parallel?
