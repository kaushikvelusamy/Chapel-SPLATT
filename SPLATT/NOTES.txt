Why is passing a barrier into another function (in a different module) not working?


Look for places with direct array assignment and see if we can replace with ref,
as a direct assignment makes a copy of the array

Change all loops to use domains, if possible. This is supposed to speed-up the runtime bounds checking

Change memcpy calls, if possible, to use direct array assignment.

Look for places to use slicing instead of loops when doing assignment

Do entire-array operations work in parallel automatically? As in, does sqrt(A) perform the sqrt() function
on each element of A in parallel?

Built in way to reduce matrix columns in Chapel (in parallel)?
