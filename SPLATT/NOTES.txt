Look for places with direct array assignment and see if we can replace with ref,
as a direct assignment makes a copy of the array

Change all loops to use domains, if possible. This is supposed to speed-up the runtime bounds checking

Change memcpy calls, if possible, to use direct array assignment.

Look for places to use slicing instead of loops when doing assignment

Replace direct C-interfacing with more Chapel-like statements

Do entire-array operations work in parallel automatically? As in, does sqrt(A) perform the sqrt() function
on each element of A in parallel?

It'd be nice to have some more fine-grain control over BLAS/LAPACK functions.

Is there a Chapel equivalent to a omp for within an omp parallel section? What happens with
a forall within a coforall?

Having a built in lock would be great
